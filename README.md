<h2> A little about me </h2>

I am a graduate student at Columbia University in the [Political Science](https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/manu-singh) department. Before this, I was a Research Specialist II at the [Empirical Studies of Conflict](https://esoc.princeton.edu/) group at Princeton University. I have also consulted at UN OCHA [Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://data.humdata.org/) as their predictive analytics fellow. I got my Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences with a Data Science Concentration.  

As a quantitative researcher, I see unprecedented opportunities to advance classic social sciences. I aspire to be part of an emerging class of social scientists that are grounded in theory and can leverage advancements in big data, remote sensing, social media channels, and statistical tools to understand our society in a whole new light.

My research interests include **social media, political communication, electoral politics, geospatial data analysis, bayesian statistics, causal inference, and machine learning.**
