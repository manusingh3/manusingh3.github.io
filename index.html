								<h3 class="media-heading"> Stabilization in Afghanistan: Trends in Violence, Attitudes, Well-Being and Program Activity</h3>
								<p align="left">This paper analyzes data from multiple sources to better understand the relationship between stabilization programming and trends in key outcomes - including: security, popular support for the government, popular support for antigovernment elements, community cohesion and resilience, health of the Afghan people, economic well-being of the Afghan people, and conflict.. Remote satellite nighttime data from the <a href="https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs.html" target="_blank">National Geophysical Data Center</a> was used to generate a measure of local economic activity and cross-validated with multiple surveys. 
								Building on prior literature which has used satellite imagery to proxy economic conditions, my unique contribution was to adapt this methodology for locations like Afghanistan where older systems had poor resolution at low light levels.
								
								</p>
								<p align="left">I also used expectation maximization algorithms to draw boundaries around urban centers, which could then be observed to grow or shrink with the flow of governmental aid.

								<h3 class="media-heading"> Understanding Risk and Resilience to Violent Conflicts</h3>
								<p align="left">This research aims to establish potential opportunities for policy intervention by asking the following question: if we could predict conflict 5-years out, what would separate the predictable failures from the unexpected successes (i.e. places where conflict was expected but did not happen) and what would separate the predictable successes from the unexpected failures (i.e. places where conflict was not expected that experience it). The idea is to move beyond standard conflict prediction variables to identify previously-unrecognized opportunities for preventive action within a time-frame sufficiently long for significant action by the UN, World Bank, and other international organizations. Put differently, our goal is to provide policy recommendations by examining what led to unexpected resilience to conflict in some countries and what happened in places with low risk based on observable characteristics.</p>

								<p align="left">Existing studies focus in on a set of states which did become affected by violent conflict without comparing them to a set of peers based on objective and replicable criteria. This study addresses this issue by looking at the set of developing countries at the end of the Cold War, predicting a priori which ones would be most likely to become affected by violent conflict, and identifying surprising successes and surprising failures. Essentially, we use machine learning to approximate what a country team would do in terms of predicting conflict risk five years out. This approach allows us to compare states which did become affected by violent conflicts (or remained in violent conflict) to states which did not (or that emerged from violent conflict). On the basis of careful comparison between matched cases, we highlight systemic differences and assess potential policies that can reduce the risk of conflict.

								<h3 class="media-heading"> Identifying Urban Households at the Highest Risk of Multiple Housing Deficiencies</h3>
								<p align="left">		This paper uses Latent Class Modeling to detect subgroups of households exposed to patterns of multiple risks within a population. Additionally, this approach forms a framework for aggregating disparate housing deficiencies such as unaffordability, structural defects and overcrowding into a single index.  Resulting Latent Class subgroups are then studied through the lens of survival analysis to understand characteristics of those households that face high risk by modeling entrance or exit from the class of maximum deficiency. Discrete time proportional hazard analysis suggests that households’ composition and householder's sex is extremely significant. Married households with education have a high likelihood of exiting the state of worst housing, while single female householders, and households with many children are at higher risk of entering the state of worst housing.  Immigrant, black and Hispanic householders are not at a disadvantage as compared to the rest of the population.

								<h3 class="media-heading">Behaviour Prediction Using Social Network Analysis</h3>
								<p align = "left"> 
								The goal of the project was to leverage both the network structure and machine

								The ‘Social Evolution’ dataset used for the study came from <a href="http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/socialevolution.html" target="_blank">MIT Human Dynamics Lab</a>. 
								The several tabular data files were reshaped to form a network adjacency matrix with multiple attributes 
								attached to each node. The output of the analysis was a classification of your health level based on the health attributes of your network. 
								The study is the primary content of my master’s thesis</p>
			
								<p align = "left"> The idea could easily be expanded to predict many major behavioral traits depending
								on the attributes provided.  
								I am currently in the process of re-running the analysis on a much larger data set (Adolescent Health Data) to understand the scalability of the method.</p>

								map leaflets, word clouds, tree maps and more. These helped us understand the underlying cyclic nature of the complaint pattern.  The goal of the project was develop a tool which could be trained on historic
								311 data to predict near term complaint distribution at zip-code level resolution. The model 
								was trained using random forest and additional features were brought in to understand complaint spikes 
								(holidays, weather conditions etc.). Factor analysis also showed strong correlations between complaint types which could be grouped together. Finally the model was tested on variety of random complaints and performed well with the exception of zip codes where there was very little training data to being with.</p>

								<h3 class="media-heading">America's Waters</h3>
								<p align = "left">At the Earth Institute (Columbia University) I was involved in a bigger project known as ‘America’s Water’ initiative where my focus was urban water infrastructure in the capacity of a coder. Some of my significant contributions were – 
<ul>
								<li align = "left">	 The development of a tool which matched water resources from three different databases 
								without any unique identifying common fields. I employed fuzzy string matching technique
								in addition to utilizing features such as elevation, drain area etc. to match names of water sources. </li>
								<li align = "left">I also worked on large scale multivariate regression analysis to understand correlation between stocks of major crops and drought (using Palmer Drought Severity Index) using USDA databases. </li>
								<li align = "left">Construction of a nationwide high resolution electricity grid network (at county specific resolution). This geo-spatial network was then transformed into a collection of cross- county voltages ratings, and used to analyze the flow 
								of power between counties and peak power calculation. </li>
								
								<p align = "left">The outcome of my work was a very fine grain network- map showing the flow of power across state and county borders. The network map when superimposed 
								with a map of known power plants helps understand hydro-electric energy distribution. Moreover, it could be used to optimize location and capacity of new power-plants that will be built in the county.
