## Applied Regression and Causal Inference (TA for Benjamin Goodrich) - Fall 2022
This Ph.D. level Quantitative Methods course focused on applied regression analysis and causal inference techniques. Topics covered linear and generalized linear models, Bayesian inference, simulation methods, causal identification strategies, and research design. The class placed equal emphasis on theoretical foundations and practical implementation. The syllabus can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nkl81kuyns5w6fw5ifmko/Applied-Regression-and-Causal-Inference.pdf?rlkey=m8n7av9jnfr3bt2bvxflq0f2b&dl=0). This class featured carefully thought unique homework assignments((example)[https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yuck7zhl79s77vjckt4ug/HW04.pdf?rlkey=wbt770kw4i619km5s4137m1ok&dl=0]) by [Ben](https://www.columbia.edu/~bg2382/) which made my job of making statistical concepts engaging and fun, so much easier. 

## Principles of Quantitative Political Research (TA for Andrew Gelman) - Fall 2021
This Ph.D.-level Quantitative Methods course covered topics such as linear regression, probability theory, Bayesian inference, model diagnostics, and data transformation. Advanced topics discussed were multilevel modeling, post-stratification, and various causal inference techniques such as instrumental variables and regression discontinuity designs. The course focus was on understanding model assumptions, quantifying uncertainty, simulation exercises, and connecting statistical concepts to substantive research questions.

## Advanced Topics in International Political Economy  (TA for Sharyn O'Halloran) - Summer 2023
This class applied international political economy concepts to global economic issues. Topics include globalization, international trade, financial regulation, development, migration, and environmental policy. I help students engage with critical themes in the political economy literature through readings, assignments, and a research project. The syllabus can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wycp9psr1hft7oi95kzz2/Advanced-Topics-in-International-Political-Economy.pdf?rlkey=axvuk9qk3s84bfi7rhk41hib4&dl=0)


## Advances in International Political Economy  (TA for Davit Sahakyan ) - Summer 2021
This class examined key issues in globalization, trade, finance, and global governance. I helped students understand canonical research and the empirical evidence on topics like international trade, financial crises, inequality, and the role of international organizations. The course featured weekly reading responses and a final research proposal. The syllabus can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dl36bpjt0gxuoaf4gv3j7/Advances-in-International-Political-Economy.pdf?rlkey=2k5mov380pu9rafhslptfc27b&dl=0)


## Introduction to Comparative Politics (TA for Kimuli Kasara) - Fall 2020
This class covered key concepts in comparative politics, with a focus on state enforcement, democracy, institutional forms of democratic government, and the impact of institutions on social outcomes. The evaluation was based on three exams and a written assignment. The syllabus can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/a70vv45w1am5zil7snrmd/Introduction-to-Comparative-Politics.pdf?rlkey=vc7bqfux9m36e3tb832dscxkw&dl=0).
