<h2> A little about me </h2>

I am a doctoral candidate in the [Political Science](https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/manu-singh) department at Columbia University. My academic journey has been enriched by diverse experiences, including roles as a Research Specialist II at Princeton University's [Empirical Studies of Conflict](https://esoc.princeton.edu/) and predictive analytics fellow at the UN OCHA's [Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://data.humdata.org/). Currently, I serve as a Research Fellow at the United Nations Department of Peace Operations, where I develop open-source large language models to detect and analyze disinformation campaigns. Previously, I worked as a Data Consultant at [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/), where I worked on backtesting and sensitivity analysis of Bayesian election forecasting models for improving reliability.

As a computational social scientist, I am motivated to transform how we study human behavior by integrating foundational social science frameworks with innovative computational approaches. Using machine learning, large language models, and advanced statistics, I aim to uncover complex patterns shaping our digital society.

My research interests include **Causal Inference, Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics, Forecasting, Survey Methods, Geospatial Data Analysis, Experimental Methods, Social Media, and Political Behavior.**
