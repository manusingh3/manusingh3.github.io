<h2> A little about me </h2>

I am a doctoral candidate in the [Political Science](https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/manu-singh) department at Columbia University. My academic journey has been enriched by diverse experiences, including roles as a Research Specialist II at Princeton University's [Empirical Studies of Conflict](https://esoc.princeton.edu/) and predictive analytics fellow at the UN OCHA's [Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://data.humdata.org/). With a Master of Arts in Applied Statistics and a Data Science Concentration from Columbia University, I've honed my skills in leveraging advanced statistical tools for problem-solving. This year, I am a non-resident fellow at [The Electoral Integrity Project](https://www.electoralintegrityproject.com/). I will also spend a significant part of the Fall 2024 semester at the [Weizenbaum Institute](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en/) as a visiting scholar to complete my dissertation.        

As a quantitative researcher, I see unprecedented opportunities to advance classic social sciences. I aspire to be part of an emerging class of scholars that are grounded in theory and can leverage advancements in big data, remote sensing, social media channels, and statistical tools to understand our society in a whole new light.

My research interests include **Causal Inference, Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics, Forecasting, Survey Methods, Geo-spatial Data Analysis, Experimental Methods, Social Media, and Political Behavior.**
